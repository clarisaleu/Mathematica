<i>In this project, I used actual data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.bea.gov) from 2015 and determined the production levels for each economic sector in order to meet the demand of the consumers and the productive sectors. I also determined which sectors were the most profitable and least profitable, which sectors have the most and least amount of excess, and discussed why this may be the case.</i><br>
